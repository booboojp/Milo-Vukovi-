              >Stefan Nikolić (Born April 15, 1889 – Died December 3, 1912) was a Montenegrin who volunteered to fight in the First Balkan War. Born in Cetinje (now Montenegro), he lived in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. There isn’t much known about his life or family. In 1912, at age 23, he volunteered with Montenegrin forces against the Ottomans. He died at the Siege of Scutari (Shkodër in present-day Albania) on December 3, 1912. Only one piece of his poetry is known to exist, but it has become a small but notable example of wartime expression and Montenegrin identity. His story and poetry have been kept alive by a small historical society, though little else about his life has been found.

              >Stefan Nikolić was born on April 15, 1889, in Cetinje (now part of Montenegro). Almost nothing is known about his early life. There are no detailed records of his family, childhood, or education. Some believe he may have spent time in the Austro-Hungarian Empire before joining the Montenegrin forces, but this remains unconfirmed.

              >Stefan Nikolić is believed to have volunteered for military service in 1912, around the age of 23. Although few specifics are recorded, it is thought he joined Montenegrin forces in their efforts against the Ottoman Empire during the First Balkan War. Nikolić’s choice to volunteer may reflect the nationalist spirit of the time, as many Montenegrins sought to push back against Ottoman influence. His last known location was at the Siege of Scutari (modern-day Shkodër, Albania), a key battle in the war, where he is believed to have fallen on December 3, 1912. No records survive about his specific role or actions, but he likely joined the ranks of many Montenegrin soldiers in the intense siege, which was marked by harsh conditions and a high number of casualties.

              >Stefan Nikolić is believed to have died on December 3, 1912, during the Siege of Scutari, a major battle in the First Balkan War. Though details are scarce, most accounts suggest he fell during one of the intense assaults on the city. His age at the time—just 23—places him among the young volunteers whose contributions are largely undocumented. Some historians speculate that, like many soldiers, Nikolić might have been part of a final push by Montenegrin forces as they fought to claim the city from the Ottoman defenders. His death was not officially recorded, so details remain largely speculative, with only a rough location and date marking his final moments.

In this brief yet haunting piece, he expresses a longing for a quiet end, shaped by the brutal realities he witnessed in war.

              >Stefan Nikolić’s legacy is marked by a single known poem, Let Me Sleep in Peace, which reflects a desire for a quiet death after witnessing the horrors of war. Though brief and simple, the poem captures a profound longing for peace, revealing the toll that conflict took on his spirit. This small piece of writing, found after his death, is his only known work and serves as a haunting reminder of the suffering endured by young soldiers like him. Beyond his poem, little else is documented about his life, leaving Let Me Sleep in Peace as his sole enduring contribution.</span>
